								<h2 class="major">Too Human</h2>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/toohuman.jpg" alt=""/></span>
								<h4>Composition and Sound Design</h4>
								<p>To be human is to be an impenetrable riddle. How can I be accepted if nobody understands me?</p>

								<p>14-year old Monty attends St. Artemis School for Mythical Creatures, an average high school for ordinary kids – who all just happen to be half-human, half-animal (her secret crush is literally a Sphinx). She shouldn’t have any trouble fitting in. Her dad is a minotaur, and her mother a mermaid – that should make her a bull/fish, right...? Unfortunately, she received the human half of both her parents... meaning she just looks like... a regular girl.</p>

								<p>With the Year 8 Disco coming up (cue 80’s music and radical dance moves) she’s desperate to be like all the other kids. How far will she go to fit in? And is it really so bad for her to just be herself?</p>
									
								<p>From emerging actor and writer Michael McStay, Too Human is a hilarious new play about growing up mixed-race and finding (and celebrating) your identity.</p>
									
								<p>Part mythology comedy, part John Hughes coming-of-age story, and 100% human.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/humandays.jpg" alt=""/></span>
								<h4>Composition and Sound Design</h4>
								<p>Only nineteen years old at the time, MacLane wrote frankly about gender, queerness, and the personal cost of making art in deep isolation during the early 20th century; despite being mocked as a raving hysteric by male critics, Mary galvanised generations of young women and changed the world forever, giving a voice to the marvellous inner complexities of youth and girlhood for the first time ever.<br><br>

									Adapted from her still-startlingly contemporary memoirs, Human Days is a heartbreaking, hilarious, and deeply queer portrait of a one-of-a-kind creative voice. A captivating mix of live video, physical theatre and contemporary art, Mary invites audiences to delve into her deviously devilish mind, find spiders floating in lukewarm bathtubs, and come face-to-face with their own reflections.</p>
