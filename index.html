								<h4>Composition and Sound Design</h4>
								<p>What if love could defy death?<br><br>

								Pat can’t bear the thought of losing his wife, Jade, to a terminal illness. Desperate to keep her with him, he secretly records their conversations, planning to recreate her with Artificial Intelligence. But when Jade discovers his plan, she’s devastated. As their remaining time together slips away, Pat must confront the true meaning of love and loss. Can he let go before it’s too late, or will his obsession with holding on push her away forever?</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/toohuman.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""/></span>
								<h4>Composition and Sound Design</h4>
								<p>To be human is to be an impenetrable riddle. How can I be accepted if nobody understands me?</p>

								<p>14-year old Monty attends St. Artemis School for Mythical Creatures, an average high school for ordinary kids – who all just happen to be half-human, half-animal (her secret crush is literally a Sphinx). She shouldn’t have any trouble fitting in. Her dad is a minotaur, and her mother a mermaid – that should make her a bull/fish, right...? Unfortunately, she received the human half of both her parents... meaning she just looks like... a regular girl.</p>

								<p>With the Year 8 Disco coming up (cue 80’s music and radical dance moves) she’s desperate to be like all the other kids. How far will she go to fit in? And is it really so bad for her to just be herself?</p>
									
								<p>From emerging actor and writer Michael McStay, Too Human is a hilarious new play about growing up mixed-race and finding (and celebrating) your identity.</p>
									
								<p>Part mythology comedy, part John Hughes coming-of-age story, and 100% human.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/humandays.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""/></span>
								<h4>Composition and Sound Design</h4>
								<p>Only nineteen years old at the time, MacLane wrote frankly about gender, queerness, and the personal cost of making art in deep isolation during the early 20th century; despite being mocked as a raving hysteric by male critics, Mary galvanised generations of young women and changed the world forever, giving a voice to the marvellous inner complexities of youth and girlhood for the first time ever.<br><br>

									Adapted from her still-startlingly contemporary memoirs, Human Days is a heartbreaking, hilarious, and deeply queer portrait of a one-of-a-kind creative voice. A captivating mix of live video, physical theatre and contemporary art, Mary invites audiences to delve into her deviously devilish mind, find spiders floating in lukewarm bathtubs, and come face-to-face with their own reflections.</p>

								<h4>Music Administration</h4>
								<p>What if love could defy death?<br><br>
								A moving and intimate portrayal of one father’s fight to save his son, Ithaka exposes the brutal realities of the campaign to free Julian Assange.<br><br>
								The world’s most famous political prisoner, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, has become an emblem of an international arm wrestle over freedom of journalism, government corruption and unpunished war crimes.<br><br>
								Now with Julian facing a 175-year sentence if extradited to the US, his family members are confronting the prospect of losing Julian forever to the abyss of the US justice system.  This David-and-Goliath struggle is personal – and, with Julian’s health declining in a British maximum-security prison, the clock is ticking.<br><br>
								Now it’s up to Julian’s father, John Shipton, and fiancé Stella Moris, to join forces to advocate for Julian on this international odyssey. As they rally a world-wide network of supporters and politicians, they cautiously step into the media’s glare – and are forced to confront the events that made Julian a global flashpoint.
